'''after school code is typed in, you click on a school -> There's already widgets on this screen 
and it's a template, since all the schools have similar info -> So basically, you don't
 need a separate file for each school, you just store all the school's info in variables and when the school is selected
 that specific school's info will display in each designated space'''
